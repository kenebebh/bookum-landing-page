We do not receive your full credit card number, credit card expiration date, or the security code. Instead, the payment provider provides us with a “token” that represents your account, your card’s expiration date, card type and the first two and last four digits of your card number. If you are required to provide your name and email address to the payment provider, then they also provide us with that information. Payments issued to Users for their content are made by Bookum using the bank account information that we have collected and stored.",
